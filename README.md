# Business Intelligence Solution for HPN

`This project aims to design and deliver an end-to-end business intelligence solution for HPN, 
which will track KPIs such as Net Sales, Profit, Orders, and Returns, 
and provide insights on a monthly, weekly, quarterly, and yearly basis.`


# Objective

`The objective of this project is to create a data analytics solution that will help HPN make informed business decisions by analyzing key metrics and providing insights into product returns and refund rates.`

# Data Description
`The dataset used in this project contains information about HPN's sales and returns, including gross sales, net sales, cost of goods sold, and other relevant metrics. The data is organized in a star or snowflake schema, with fact tables storing the measures and dimension tables describing the dimensions.`

# Data Normalization

`In this project, data normalization was performed to organize the data in a database, eliminating redundancy and inconsistent dependency. This process involved creating tables and establishing relationships between those tables according to rules designed to protect the data and make the database more flexible. `
# Metrics Tracked

 The following metrics were tracked in this project:

`Gross Sales: The total amount of sales without any deductions.`

`Net Sales: The total revenue generated by the company, excluding any sales returns, allowances, and discounts.`

`Cost of Goods Sold: The total cost of producing and selling the products.`

`Profit: The difference between gross sales and cost of goods sold.`

`Returns: The number of products returned by customers.`

`Refund Rates: The percentage of products returned that were refunded.`

# Dimension Tables

`Dimension tables were used to describe dimensions, including time, which contained every hour, day, week, month, quarter, and year that has occurred since HPN started its business operations. `

# Insights Provided

` This project provides insights into the products with the highest returns and refund rates, as well as trends in the tracked metrics on a monthly, weekly, quarterly, and yearly basis.`

# Conclusion
`The business intelligence solution developed in this project provides HPN with valuable insights into its sales and returns, helping it make informed decisions and improve its operations.
